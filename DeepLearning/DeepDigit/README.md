# DeepDigit

    
### `DeepDigit` is a web application built with TensorFlow.js that allows to train a deep learning model in the browser (both in mobile and laptop) to recognize the handwritten digits.

### The application provides real-time feedback on the training process, including training loss and accuracy for both training data and validation data on an epoch-by-epoch and batch-by-batch basis.

### The application uses HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to capture and preprocess the user's drawing, and TensorFlow.js to train and perform the digit classification.

### The training speed may vary depending on the device and computational power on which it is running.

# Future Plans

###  <input type="checkbox" disabled checked/> Future plans for `DeepDigit` include enabling customization of certain parameters of the neural network architecture. This will allow for the training and testing of custom models using the application.

### <input type="checkbox" disabled checked/> In addition to custom model training, I am working on integrating pre-trained models into `DeepDigit`. This will enhance the application's digit classification capabilities and provide an additional tool for users to leverage.

### <input type="checkbox" disabled checked/>I am also working on making "DeepDigit" more mobile-friendly. While the current version allows for training on mobile, I plan to implement the ability to draw digits on the canvas using mobile devices in the future.
